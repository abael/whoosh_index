master_index
============

The subdirectories within this master branch contain the source code used to generate and parse a full text index with which to study the literary influences that helped shape the writing of Sir Geoffrey Hill. The .py file within `create_master_index` was used to create our research index on the University of Notre Dame's Center for Research Computing servers, and the .py file within `parse_master_index` was cloned by higher-order scripts in order to parse Hill's poetry in a parallel fashion. The orthographic variants called within the `parse_master_index` function are contained within the `orthographic_variants` subdirectory.
